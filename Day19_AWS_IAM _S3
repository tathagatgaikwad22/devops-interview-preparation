# üöÄ Day 19 of 30 Days DevOps Interview Preparation  
## Topic: AWS IAM + S3 (Users, Roles, Upload Files)

Welcome to Day 19! Today we dive into **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** and **Amazon S3**, two of the most fundamental building blocks in AWS cloud security and storage.  

---

## üìò Theory

### üîë AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
IAM is a secure way to manage **access** to AWS resources.  
- **Users** ‚Üí Individual accounts with credentials (username, password, access keys).  
- **Groups** ‚Üí Collection of users with shared permissions.  
- **Roles** ‚Üí Temporary credentials for AWS services or federated access.  
- **Policies** ‚Üí JSON-based permissions documents attached to users, groups, or roles.  

‚úÖ Best Practices:
- Follow **principle of least privilege**.  
- Use **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** for extra security.  
- Avoid using **root account** for daily tasks.

### ü™£ Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
S3 is an **object storage service** used to store files (objects) inside **buckets**.  
- **Buckets** ‚Üí Top-level containers for storing data.  
- **Objects** ‚Üí Files with metadata stored inside buckets.  
- **Storage Classes** ‚Üí Standard, Infrequent Access, Glacier, etc.  
- **Versioning** ‚Üí Keep multiple versions of the same file.  
- **Encryption** ‚Üí Protect files at rest and in transit.  

‚úÖ Use Cases:  
- Backup & restore  
- Hosting static websites  
- Big data storage  
- Application logs

## üõ† Practical: Step-by-Step  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create IAM User
1. Go to **AWS Management Console ‚Üí IAM**.  
2. Click **Users ‚Üí Add user**.  
3. Choose `Programmatic access` (for CLI/SDK) or `AWS Management Console access`.  
4. Attach an existing policy (e.g., `AmazonS3FullAccess`).  
5. Download `.csv` file with **Access Key & Secret Key**.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure AWS CLI with IAM User
```bash
aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: <YourAccessKey>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <YourSecretKey>
Default region name [None]: ap-south-1
Default output format [None]: json

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create an S3 Bucket

aws s3 mb s3://devops-interview-prep-day19

4Ô∏è‚É£ Upload a File to S3

echo "Hello from Day 19 of DevOps Prep!" > day19.txt
aws s3 cp day19.txt s3://devops-interview-prep-day19/

5Ô∏è‚É£ List Files in S3 Bucket

aws s3 ls s3://devops-interview-prep-day19/

6Ô∏è‚É£ Attach IAM Role to EC2 for S3 Access
Go to IAM ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí Create Role.

Choose EC2 as trusted entity.

Attach AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess policy.

Attach this role to an EC2 instance.

Verify from EC2 terminal:

aws s3 ls s3://devops-interview-prep-day19/

üí° Common Interview Questions (with Answers)
Q1: What is the difference between an IAM User and an IAM Role?
Answer:
IAM User is tied to a person or application with long-term credentials.
IAM Role is temporary and assumed by AWS services or external identities.

Q2: How does S3 ensure data durability?
Answer: Amazon S3 provides 11 nines of durability (99.999999999%) by automatically replicating objects across multiple availability zones.

Q3: How do you secure S3 buckets?
Answer:
Enable bucket policies and IAM policies.
Use MFA delete for extra protection.
Apply encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS).
Block public access unless explicitly required.

Q4: What is the difference between S3 and EBS?
Answer:
S3 is object storage (scalable, global access).
EBS is block storage (attached to EC2 instances, high-performance).

Q5: How would you allow EC2 to upload files to S3 without credentials?
Answer: By creating an IAM Role with S3 write permissions and attaching it to the EC2 instance.

üìå Summary
IAM is the security backbone of AWS.

S3 is a scalable storage service used everywhere in cloud-native apps.

Together, IAM + S3 form the basis for secure data storage and access control.
