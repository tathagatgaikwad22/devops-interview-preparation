# 🚀 Day 18 of 30 Days DevOps Interview Preparation  
## AWS EC2: Launch VM & Connect with Key  

This file is part of my **30 Days DevOps Interview Preparation Challenge**.  
Today’s focus: **AWS EC2 – Launching Virtual Machines and Connecting Securely using Key Pairs**.  

---

## 📌 What is AWS EC2?  

AWS **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** provides scalable virtual machines in the cloud.  
Key features:  
- Pay-as-you-go compute power.  
- Multiple operating systems via AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).  
- Different pricing models (On-Demand, Reserved, Spot).  
- Integration with AWS services like S3, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch.  

Think of EC2 as a **cloud computer** that you rent from AWS.

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step: Launching an EC2 Instance  

### **1. Log in to AWS Console**
- Go to [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).  
- Navigate to **EC2** service.  

### **2. Launch Instance**
- Click **Launch Instance**.  
- Select **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** (e.g., Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu).  

### **3. Choose Instance Type**
- Select `t2.micro` for free tier.  

### **4. Configure Key Pair**
- Create/download a **Key Pair (.pem)**.  
- This will be used to securely connect via SSH.  

### **5. Configure Security Group**
- Allow **SSH (22)** for your IP.  
- Add rules for **HTTP (80)** or **HTTPS (443)** if needed.  

### **6. Launch & Connect**
- Copy the **Public IP** once instance is running.  
- Connect using SSH:

chmod 400 mykey.pem
ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP>
✅ You’re inside your AWS virtual machine now!

🔐 Security Best Practices for EC2
Restrict SSH to only your IP (avoid 0.0.0.0/0).
Never share .pem files.
Assign an Elastic IP if a static IP is needed.
Use IAM roles instead of embedding access keys.
Enable CloudWatch monitoring for metrics.

💡 Practical Demo: Deploy a Web Server
Install and run Nginx on EC2:

sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
Now visit:

http://<EC2-Public-IP>
You’ll see the Nginx Welcome Page 🎉

❓ Common EC2 Interview Questions & Answers
Q1. What is an AMI in AWS EC2?
👉 An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a template containing the OS, application server, and configurations used to launch instances.

Q2. What’s the difference between On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot Instances?
On-Demand: Flexible, pay-per-use, no commitment.
Reserved: 1–3 year commitment, cheaper for predictable workloads.
Spot: Up to 90% cheaper, but can be terminated anytime.

Q3. How do you connect to an EC2 instance securely?
👉 Using SSH with the .pem key pair created during launch:
ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP>

Q4. Why might you fail to SSH into EC2?
Possible reasons:
Security Group doesn’t allow inbound SSH (port 22).
Wrong key permissions (chmod 400).
Wrong username (ec2-user for Amazon Linux, ubuntu for Ubuntu).
Instance not running or incorrect Public IP.

Q5. How does EC2 fit into DevOps pipelines?
Acts as a build/test server in CI/CD pipelines.
Hosts containerized or non-containerized applications.
Can run self-hosted GitHub Actions runners or Jenkins agents.

📌 Key Takeaways for Day 18
Learned how to launch & connect to an EC2 instance.
Understood security best practices for EC2.
Practiced deploying a simple Nginx server.
Revised frequent EC2 interview Q&A.
