# Day 28 – Resume Writing (ATS-Friendly) + LinkedIn Update  

Welcome to **Day 28 of the 30 Days of DevOps Interview Preparation Challenge**.  
Today’s focus is not on tools but on **how to present yourself effectively** through an **ATS-friendly resume** and an optimized **LinkedIn profile**.  

---

## 📖 Why ATS-Friendly Resume Matters  

- **ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)** are used by most companies to filter resumes.  
- A resume may get rejected if it:  
  - Does not contain required **keywords** (e.g., AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform).  
  - Uses heavy graphics or complex designs.  
- The goal: Make your resume **machine-readable** and **keyword-optimized**.

## 📝 Structure of a DevOps Resume  

1. **Header**  
   - Name | Contact Number | Email | GitHub | LinkedIn  

2. **Summary** (2–3 lines)  
   - Example: *“DevOps Engineer with hands-on experience in AWS Cloud, CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions), Docker, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code using Terraform. Passionate about automation and monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana.”*  

3. **Skills (Grouped by Categories)**  
   - **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI  
   - **Cloud**: AWS (EC2, IAM, S3, EKS)  
   - **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes  
   - **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Ansible  
   - **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana  
   - **Scripting**: Bash, Python  

4. **Projects (STAR Method)**  
   - **Situation** → Problem  
   - **Task** → What you needed to do  
   - **Action** → What tools/tech you used  
   - **Result** → Outcome/impact  

   **Example Project (AWS Practical)**  
   - Built a CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** for a Loan Management App.  
   - Automated Docker image builds & pushed to DockerHub.  
   - Provisioned AWS EC2 infrastructure with **Terraform**.  
   - Configured monitoring with **Prometheus & Grafana**.  
   - 🚀 *Reduced deployment time from 2 hours to 15 minutes.*  

5. **Experience**  
   - Highlight DevOps-related tasks, even if from application support background.  
   - Example: *Automated log analysis with Bash scripts, reducing manual effort by 30%.*  

6. **Education & Certifications**  
   - AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner / Solutions Architect  
   - CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)  
   - Terraform Associate

## 🔗 LinkedIn Profile Optimization  

- **Profile Picture** → Professional headshot.  
- **Headline Example** → *“DevOps Engineer | AWS | CI/CD | Docker | Kubernetes | Terraform”*  
- **About Section** → 3–4 lines about your DevOps journey.  
- **Projects Section** → Add GitHub project links & blogs.  
- **Engagement** → Share learnings, write posts, comment in DevOps communities.

## 🛠 AWS Project Ideas for Resume & LinkedIn  

1. CI/CD Pipeline on AWS EC2 using GitHub Actions.  
2. Dockerized Application Deployment on AWS ECS/EKS.  
3. Infrastructure Automation with Terraform (EC2, S3, IAM).  
4. Monitoring EC2 with Prometheus + Grafana.  

👉 Even **one well-documented GitHub project** can be more powerful than listing 10 tools.
